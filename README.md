# Bivariate Dam Removals by Ecoregion and Study Type

Dam removals are an increasingly used method for restoring riverine ecosystems.  As normal flow, temperature, and sediment regimes return to a "normal" state, success stories of aquatic habitats and spawning grounds are common in academic literature.  However, not all dams are studied.  While there is increase in studies, the rate still falls behind that of dam removals.  As these dams approach the end of their intended lifespan, dam managers and owners are increasingly opting for removal over rehabilitation and looking to past removals as examples.  However, current mapping of removals do not consider their unique geographic locations.

Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I aim to create a database and web application for stakeholders, policymakers, and scientists to compare dam removals based on unique watershed characteristics.  This map is the first zoom level the user will interact with; ecoregions and study type.
